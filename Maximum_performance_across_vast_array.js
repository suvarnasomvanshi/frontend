//
A session is started with mongoose.startSession().
session.startTransaction() is called to start the transaction.
The update operations are performed within the transaction, and the session is passed as an option to each operation.
If all operations succeed, session.commitTransaction() commits the transaction.
If any operation fails, the catch block catches the error, and session.abortTransaction() aborts the transaction.
Finally, session.endSession() ends the session, regardless of whether the transaction was committed or aborted.
// This ensures that all the operations within the transaction either succeed or fail together, maintaining data consistency.
